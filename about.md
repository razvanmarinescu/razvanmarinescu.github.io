I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Polina Golland's lab](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/) at MIT, working on machine learning algorithms for healthcare applications. I currently develop generative models on Chest X-Rays and brain images, which can be used for data augmentation, visualisation, and as prior models for bayesian posterior optimisation.

I also have a keen interest in general machine learning and computational intelligence, in order to make computers perform intelligent tasks. 

See [my website](https://razvanmarinescu.com) for more information on my research.
